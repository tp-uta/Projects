#Brilli the ant is trying to get from point A to point B in a grid. The coordinates of
#point AA is (1,1) (this is top left corner), and the coordinates of point B is (n,n) (this is bottom right corner, n is the size of the grid).
#Once Brilli starts moving, there are four options, it can go right, left, up or down (no diagonal
#movement allowed) with the corresponding probability of 0.5, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1, respectively. If
#any of these four options satisfy the following:
# The new point should still be within the boundaries of the n√ón grid
# The new point should not be visited previously.
#the new point will be selected randomly among the remaining valid options.
#If P is the probability of Brilli the ant reaching point B for a 6x6 grid, use Monte Carlo simulation to compute P.
#Calculate P for 4x4, 6x6, 8x8, 10x10 grids to obtain a dependence trend of P on the grid size.

#Defining the lattice#
#The extra 2 columns and rows are to define the boundaries
#It will output an n+2 x n+2 matrix with the edges having a value of -1.0 to indicate that these are boundaries
#Removing the boundaries will yield an n x n matrix that will be the grid size we want to test
#The extra columns and rows are to simplify the code for testing the boundaries
#Places where the walker has been is indicated by positive integer values that start at 1
#Places that haven't been visited and are not boundaries have values of 0.0
